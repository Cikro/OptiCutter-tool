# OptiCutter Tool

[OptiCutter linear cut calculator](https://www.opticutter.com/linear-cut-list-calculator) is a website that I ran accross when planning to build a new desk.

Given:
 * The kerf of your saw
 * A list of boards on hand
 * Their length
 * A list of boards you want to have
 * Their length

Opticutter will calculate how many boards you will need to use from your stock, and how to cut them to end up with the boards that you want.

The website is session based and provides an option to print a PDF of your results.

This program allows you to set up a request, run the calculator, and save a pdf of the results without having to go to their webbsite and enter/import information using their UI.

## But Why?
I need to run their tool a handful of times and using their UI is a bit of a pain.


Reasons for running their tool a bunch:
1. I want to minimize the cost of my desk. The price of the desks depends on the cost/inch of different board lengths. By using the "Boards in Stock" as "Boards I can buy from" and trying different scenarios, I can see how many of each board I would need to buy, and use the price of each board to calculate the total price of lumber for each scenario.  
2. I don't know what length of boards I can actually transport or if I will be able borrow a truck from someone when I need to buy.
3. I haven't completly decided on the what width I want my desk to be yet.
4. The design of my desk may change slightly. 
5. I may have forgotten to include kerf the first time too...
